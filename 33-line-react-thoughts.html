    <h1>33 line React - thoughts</h1>
    <p>
        <em><a href="33-line-react.html">Original post</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22776753">original discussion</a>.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        There were lots of insightful comments in the hacker news thread - thanks, I thought I'd write up some of the thoughts that came out of it. Looking now, this may just be a rant piece - I'll let you decide. In a vaguely Top-Gear-esque way, this post is split into <a href="#style">style</a>, <a href="#performance">performance</a>, <a href="#conclusions">conclusions</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>TLDR</h1>
    <p>Have a go building your next frontend with <em>an as simple as possible</em> <code>pageState -> DOM</code> model, maybe use <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>.</p>


    <h2 id="style"><code>.jsx</code>, state management and aesthetics</h2>
    <p>
        The React homepage, has the following snippet:
    </p>
    <pre><code>class Timer extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { seconds: 0 };
    }
    tick() {
        this.setState(state => ({
            seconds: state.seconds + 1
        }));
    }
    componentDidMount() {
        this.interval = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
        clearInterval(this.interval);
    }
    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div>
                Seconds: {this.state.seconds}
            &lt;/div>
        );
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
        Versus, for example, the code for the noughts and crosses in my <a href="33-line-react.html">original post</a>, there's a huge amount of ceremony here. I have to:
        <ul id="ceremony">
            <li>Do some OO gubbins.</li>
            <li>Wrap all calls to update the state with <code>this.setState(...)</code>.</li>
            <li>Conform with quite a large API.</li>
            <li>Constantly pass state around with <code>props</code> and <code>this.state</code> (I understand some of this has been sorted with hooks, right?).</li>
            <li>Compile the JSX to boring js.</li>
        </ul>
        There are alleged performance/codebase management reasons for some of these, but I remain a bit sceptical of their applicability to "normal" sized web applications.
    </p>
    <h3 id="ezzthetic">Ezz-thetic</h3>
    <p>
        To my eyes, the original mithril <a href="https://raw.githack.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js/master/examples/todomvc/todomvc.js">TodoMVC source</a> is exceptionally expressive and handsome, especially versus the equivalent React <a href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/react">example</a>. Maybe I'm turning into Arthur Whitney, but I'm kind of enjoying long, dense lines like:
    </p>
    <pre><code>m("section#main", {style: {display: state.todos.length > 0 ? "" : "none"}}, [
    m("input#toggle-all[type='checkbox']", {checked: state.remaining === 0, onclick: ui.toggleAll})
    ...</code></pre>
    <p>Consider the recommended React/JSX equivalent:</p>
    <pre><code>if (todos.length) {
    main = (
        &lt;section className="main">
            &lt;input
                id="toggle-all"
                className="toggle-all"
                type="checkbox"
                onChange={this.toggleAll}
                checked={activeTodoCount === 0}
            />
            &lt;label
                htmlFor="toggle-all"
            />
            &lt;ul className="todo-list">
                {todoItems}
            &lt;/ul>
        &lt;/section>
    );
}</code></pre>
    <h3>Routing</h3>
    <p>
        As a consumer of webpages, I'm not sure I've ever seen the URL change in an SPA and thought "phewph, I'm glad I wasn't redirected to a new page" - just gimme a normal <code>&lt;a></code> and split your app up yo.
    </p>

    <h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
    <p>
        I had a very unscientific play around with this neat <a href="https://localvoid.github.io/uibench/">benchmarking tool</a>, you can use the "Custom URL"s <code>http://leontrolski.github.io</code> <code>/benchmark</code>, <code>/benchmark/mithril.html</code>, <code>/benchmark/lit-html.html</code> to compare yourself. I'm going to keep the performance figures intentionally vague - I was comparing Vanilla JS, React 16, mithril and 33-line.
        <ul>
            <li>React and mithril performed very similarly.</li>
            <li>React tended to be faster than 33-line by a factor of 2 to 10.</li>
            <li>The Vanilla JS solution would often outperform 33-line.</li>
            <li>For smaller DOM trees, often the <em>winner</em> was Vanilla JS (small discussion below).</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://localvoid.github.io/uibench-react/16/main.js">React code</a> was (gzipped + minified) 40kb, the <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/benchmark/main.js">33-line code</a> was (gzipped, not minified) 1.8kb, mithril was (gzipped + minified) 9kb.</li>
            <li>The "JS Init Time" of react would be 2 to 10+ times slower than both 33-line and mithril, think in the order of +100ms.</li>
            <li>The performance of 33-line got proportially worse as the number of divs increased, this makes sense, given the diff algorithm is <em>basic</em>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/">lit-html</a> performs a weenie bit quicker than mithril in some benchmarks, but has a longer "JS Init Time" time. Admittedly, <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/leontrolski.github.io/blob/master/benchmark/lit-html.html">my implementation</a> is a naive translation of the mithril code, so may be missing some tricks.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Performance - Notes</h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/leontrolski.github.io/blob/4f9cea8a5afc55252d38eb1aa1a20eda264a880f/benchmark/main.js">Vanilla JS one</a> just shoves strings of html together and does a big <code>container.innerHTML =</code>, nice and simple. On the other hand, string munging sucks for obvious reasons. Also, you end up with a lot of updates flashing around in the devtools inspector.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had to write a <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/leontrolski.github.io/blob/54bb7ff011065f0d46ae8f2e3c841dc3aa30c157/benchmark/main.js#L67-L69">few extra lines</a> of 33-line to handle <code>data-</code> attributes, that cranked it up to 37 lines. I think if you were to try productionise this toy code you'd end up with about 3/4 of a <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I did one run with the <a href="https://github.com/Freak613/stage0">stage0</a> library thingy, the code was a bit more <a href="https://github.com/Freak613/stage0/blob/master/examples/uibench/app.js">gnarly</a>, but it was <em>rapid</em>. If I was writing eg. a game or a big spreadsheet app that needed high performance, I'd definitely be considering a library in this space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things that I'd imagine React particularly excels at versus a naive approach would be things like clock counters/animations - small bits of the DOM changing at high frequency - the tradeoff for this performance seems to be state-management-based API complexity. If one is to use a simpler <code>pageState -> DOM</code> model with few library hooks into the guts, it may be necessary to implement clocks etc. out of band of the normal library's render loop.
    </p>


    <h2>Hacker news meta bit</h2>
    <p>
        For a while, the top-voted thread was people moaning about how a variable was called <code>m</code>, then a later comment in the code said it was a <code>grid</code>. I agree it was maybe a bit annoying, but I dunno, you read the article and that was your takeaway.. I've been part of a fair few code reviews with this vibe in my time :-)
    </p>

    <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
    <p>
        Doing <code>document.querySelectorAll('*')</code> on the airbnb map view (a reasonably complex SPA) returns <b>3407</b> elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        With no thought to performance at all, a simple library can render in the order of 100s of divs per <em>millisecond</em>. You could probably swap React out with 33-line on most sites and no-one would notice, you could also swap it out with some Vanilla JS string munging too - although the developer egonomics would be a bit rubbish.
    </p>
    <p>
        In their next project, I'd recommended any frontend devs out there embrace there inner minimalist and cut the <a href="#ceremony">fat</a>. Make a plain ol' <code>state</code> variable at the top of your file, throw in some functions that mutate it, a touch of <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a> to render it, and bang, you're done.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your site's slow (unless you're something really complicated like a game/spreadsheet), it's probably that you put a lot of crap on it, rather than anything to do with how you render your divs.
