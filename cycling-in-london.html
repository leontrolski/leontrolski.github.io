                <b>
                    Quicker
                </b>
                 - Door-to-door times will tend to be quicker than any other mode of transport. Think half an hour for most Zone 1 and 2 journeys.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    Cheaper
                </b>
                 - Obvious, but worth running the numbers on your regular tube/bus journeys vs the cost of bike ownership, you&#39;ll probably save a lot of money.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    More pleasant
                </b>
                 - Cramming yourself on a busy tube sucks, get out in the open! Also, there&#39;s far less heavy rain than you might expect - I probably don my rain jacket 5 times a year.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    Get to know the city
                </b>
                 - After a few months cycling, central London feels a lot smaller, it feels great to know little cut-throughs between places, notice new shops opening, see people you recognise etc.
            </li>

            If you&#39;re not in a mad hurry, there are many bits of cycle infrastructure in London that are far more pleasant and safe than the obvious roads. Let&#39;s use the example of a journey from Liverpool Street to Angel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is Google maps - it will tend to send you direct on busy roads:

            </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            In comparison,             <a href="https://cycle.travel">
                cycle.travel
            </a>
             sends you on nice cycle infrastructure, it will take a bit more brain power to navigate, but definitely worth it for a regular journey:

            Staying safe
        </h2>
        <p>
            Once you&#39;re off the main roads (see above), cycling in London is pretty safe, in fact it feels a lot safer than in most other UK cities. To reduce the likelihood of being involved in a crash, here are some tips on staying safe, take time to ingest them properly.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Be super-duper careful around trucks - considering how few of them there are, a crazy high proportion of bad cycling accidents involve them.                 <ul>
                    <li>
                        Don&#39;t undertake them. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Don&#39;t plonk yourself right in front of them at the lights.
                    </li>

                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                Assume everyone else is going to do something dumb at any moment:                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If a car is pulling out of a side road, until you&#39;ve caught their eye, assume they haven&#39;t seen you and will pull out any second.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you&#39;re cycling near parked cars, leave a door&#39;s width.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If it looks like someone&#39;s about to walk into the middle of the road without looking, they probably will.
                    </li>

                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                Consciously make yourself aware of your surroundings:                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Don&#39;t wear headphones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you&#39;re overtaking and there&#39;s a gap in traffic, it&#39;s likely someone will pull out of a side street into said gap.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Look over your shoulder every few seconds to get a feel of what&#39;s around.
                    </li>

                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                Take your time - most near misses I see are bikes trying to squeeze through little gaps to shave 3 seconds off their commute.
            </li>

            Getting a bike

        <p>
            I&#39;ve heard great things about             <a href="https://swapfiets.co.uk/london">
                Swapfiets
            </a>
            . You pay monthly and it comes to about Â£200 a year. The bikes have lights, locks and mudguards built in. If it breaks, they come fix it. If it gets stolen, you pay a small fee for a new one. Simple!
        </p>
        <p>
            After a year or so, you might realise you want to buy your own bike that&#39;s quicker/will carry more stuff/will handle             <a href="/cycling.html">
                longer trips
            </a>
            , you can cross that bridge when you get there.
        </p>
        <p>
            My experience with Boris bikes (Kencycles?)/dockless schemes is that the bikes are cumbersome and the parking faffy. Just get the Swapfiets.

            Personal advice would be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Get a                 <a href="https://mobil.abus.com/int/on-road/Highlights/BORDO/Folding-Locks">
                    folding style
                </a>
                 lock, these are fairly light, fit around most stuff and I&#39;ve not had a bike knicked while using one for many years ðŸ¤ž.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lock inside where possible (if you work in an office, there will likely be a safe place).
            </li>
            <li>
                Some councils have &#39;cycle hangars&#39; if you don&#39;t have storage at home -                 <a href="https://hackney.gov.uk/cycle-safety-and-security">
                    Hackney
                </a>
                 in particular seems good for this.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simply don&#39;t have your regular bike be something flashy and expensive.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            My friend Cal did a nice writeup on             <a href="https://calpaterson.com/bicycle-threat-model.html">
