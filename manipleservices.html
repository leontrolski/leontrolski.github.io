    <h1>Manipleservices</h1>
    <p class="georgian">Maniple: <em>a subdivision of a Roman legion</em>. From manipulus:
        <em>bundle, handful.</em>
    </p>
    <h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
    <p>Discussions of system design often focus on one of two
        architectures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Trad Monolith</strong> - one service, handling entire
                requests vertically via function calls.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Modern Classic Microservices</strong> - many services,
                running on independent machines (or VMs or Pods), talking over the
                network (usually REST or some message bus).</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This neat lumping together of ideas (think left-wing/right-wing) isn't particularly
        helpful when it comes to solving our problems effectively - we're free to pick
        and choose ideas from each approach.
    </p>
    <p>With that in mind, this document aims to decompose these approaches into
        (somewhat) orthogonal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Aims</strong> - what are the actual development/production
                aims we're trying to achieve?</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Methods</strong> - How to structure the code? How should
                components of the system communicate? etc.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It then <a href="#proposal">proposes</a> a third approach - <strong>Manipleservices</strong>
        - with the target of maximising our aims,
        in commonly encountered software environments, given our available methods.
        There is an accompanying skeleton
        <a href="https://github.com/leontrolski/manipleservices/tree/main#manipleservices">Python + CircleCI repo</a> -
        variations on the ideas in this repo can be applied to a wide variety of codebases.
        The main takeaway from this document is just a restatement of YAGNI:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="georgian">
        Start your architecture as simply as possible. As your system grows, work out what <b>aims</b> you have,
        and pick <b>methods</b> that best reach those aims. Don't choose methods based on ideologies,
        that solve problems you may never have, often at significant cost.
    </blockquote>
    <p><em><small>To be more generic, service-like units of the system will be
            referred to as "components" instead of "services".</small></em></p>
    <h1 id="aims"><strong>Aims</strong></h1>
    <p>Regardless of the methods we choose, we tend to hold the same aims.
        Some of them end up being conflicting in reality, and their
        costs/benefits need to be weighed up against one another.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Reliability</strong> - The system should keep working for the
                end user.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Database</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>

                    <p><strong>Isolation</strong> - Frequent, difficult-to-avoid incidents
                        are often caused by schema migrations, query planner changes etc. We
                        would like these to be isolated.</p>

                </li>
                <li>

                    <p><strong>Performance</strong> (assuming a conventional db) - After
                        we've reached the limits of vertical scaling, we would like to be able
                        to split the data to achieve some level of horizontal scaling. For most
                        companies, application-code performance is irrelevant as apps scale
                        easily and they're cheap to run.</p>

                </li>
                <li>

                    <p><strong>Consistency</strong> - ACID-ier the better.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Performance</strong> - The system should run quickly for the end user,
            without being too pricey for the company running it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>CI</strong> - The CI should run quickly, both running tests
                and deploying components.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Developer Ergonomics</strong> - Developers would like to be
                able to <a href="https://leontrolski.github.io/cmd-click-manifesto.html">CMD-click things</a>, they'd like their tests to run fast, they'd
                like to have confidence their one-line change doesn't break something
                miles away, they'd like well-typed data to work with.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Testing</strong> - Testing any slice of the system - from
                unit tests through to cross component tests - should be easy.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Organisational</strong> - Management want to have specific teams responsible for
                specific bits of the code, both during development and running in prod.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Debugging</strong> - It should be easy to isolate the cause
                of production problems and recreate them locally. If something starts
                breaking, it should be easy to say - "change X caused this to start
                breaking". It would be nice to be able to run two versions of a component in production to
                see which one doesn't work.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1 id="methods"><strong>Methods</strong></h1>
    <h2 id="splitting-into-components">Splitting Into Components</h2>
    <p>Splitting into more small components (as opposed to fewer large
        components) simply magnifies the effects of the other methods below.</p>
    <h2 id="dependency-specification">Dependency Specification</h2>
    <p>Monoliths tend to very <em>loosely</em> specify "this code depends on
        this other code", often via language-level imports. In the wild,
        microservices also tend to loosely specify dependencies by enumerating
        service URLs in some config file.</p>
    <p>An explicit dependency graph has many advantages, it can be achieved
        with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            <p>Language-level packages (eg. Installable Python packages + lists of
                requirements).</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p>File-level build system (eg. <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a>).</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An explicit dependency graph enables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            <p>Quicker <strong>CI</strong> - <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/continuePipeline">only build/test/deploy</a> things that
                changed/that's dependencies changed.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p>More comprehensive <strong>testing</strong> - we know if we change
                component A, we should run the integration tests covering {A, B, C}.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p>Better <strong>developer ergonomics</strong> - tests run quicker, the
                section of system to bear in mind while working on a task is
                reduced.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: the <strong>aims</strong> achieved by using this method are
        <em>mostly</em> <em>independent</em> from those achieved using the other
        methods.
    </p>

    <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
    <p>The most common ways components communicate are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Language-level function calls.
        </li>
        <li>
            REST.
        </li>
        <li>
            Message buses.
        </li>
        <li>
            RPC frameworks.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using function calls means it's difficult to achieve
        <strong>deployment independence</strong> (see below), however there are
        numerous downsides to picking any of the other options in regards to
        <strong>developer ergonomics</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Typing tends to be rubbish without significant investment in wacky
                (often codegen-based) tooling - see gRPC and friends.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>CMD-clickability goes out the window, back to grep.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are also various performance costs to constantly serialising
        and flinging data over the wire.</p>
    <p>Using message buses introduces further <strong>deployment
            independence</strong> - if one service is down, the caller can still
        give it work to do later. However there are often large
        <strong>debugging</strong> costs - where did that message
        originally come from?
    </p>

    <h2 id="deployment-independence">Deployment Independence</h2>
    <p>The ability to deploy different components to
        different types of machines, and also to scale parts of the system
        independently we refer to as deployment independence. Deployment independence
        often comes together with version independence (see below), but it's possible
        to have one without the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having things deployed separately can help <strong>organisationally</strong>,
        for example, different teams can be billed according to their resource usage.
        Occasionally, different types of workers might be more suitable for different types of
        workloads, for example, there might be some <strong>performance</strong> reason to serve user
        requests by some magic cloud worker near to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        The case that deployment independence in and of itself enables scaling is somewhat overstated.
        Consider an inbound request that hits component <code>A</code>, this in turn talks to component <code>B</code>.
        If <code>B</code> takes 98% of the CPU, there's a temptation to make <code>B</code> a separately deployed component,
        this means you can scale up the number of machines accordingly right? This only acheives anything meaningful where the work done by <code>B</code>
        is parallelisable <em>for each original call to <code>A</code></em>, if this is not the case, you may as well deploy
        <code>A+B</code> on every machine and scale them together.
    </p>

    <h2 id="version-independence">Version Independence</h2>
    <p>
        This is the ability to have different versions of components running in prod together.
    </p>
    </p>
        An important use case is the ability to eg: deploy v1.3.7 of your payments service
        alongside v1.3.6, directing 10% of traffic to the former and 90% of traffic to the latter.
        This should lead to increased <strong>reliability</strong> as you can test new software
        for a subset of users and automatically roll back if some threshold of errors is crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to test pre-prod, there are significant <strong>testing</strong> tooling
        problems to overcome - are you going to test against the cross-product of
        possible interacting services? Some small <strong>developer ergonomics</strong>
        friction is introduced - if I CMD-click, do I hit the version of the function
        that is deployed and causing bugs? Similar pain is introduced whilst <strong>debugging</strong>.
        Also, there is often significant tooling overhead introduced implementing versioning and deploying versions
        of packages (see the example below).
    </p>

    <h2 id="separate-repos">Separate Repos</h2>
    <p>Choosing many-repos vs monorepo mostly impacts <strong>developer
            ergonomics</strong> and <strong>CI</strong>.</p>
    <p>One downside of many-repos is duplication of component level
        boilerplate (think CircleCI config etc). The flipside with monorepos is
        that tooling like Github/CircleCI can get a bit overwhelming, it should be
        possible to overcome this with tooling though.</p>
    <p>
        The bigger downside with many-repos is that it <strong id="rot">induces code rot</strong>. In a monorepo,
        if there is a small cleanup to do with a bit of library code, you:
        <ol>
            <li>Make the fix.</li>
            <li>Run linters/tests.</li>
            <li>Fix everything downstream.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2-3.</li>
        </ol>
        With many-repos, you:
        <ol>
            <li>Make the fix.</li>
            <li>Upversion the library's package.</li>
            <li>Deploy the package to some repository.</li>
            <li>Work out which downstream things depend on the library.</li>
            <li>For each downstream thing:
                <ul>
                    <li>Upversion the dependency.</li>
                    <li>Work out how to run the linters/tests.</li>
                    <li>Run the linters/tests.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Realise you made a small error in the original fix.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 1-6.</li>
        </ol>
        What tends to happen is people either make the fix and ignore steps 2 onwards, thereby
        making people downstream wary of updating. <strong>Or they just don't make the fix</strong>.
        At Google, people making wide-reaching changes are responsible for cleaning up at least
        80% of the mess they make - this is the way it should be.
    </p>
    <p>In theory, the decision to have one/many-repos should be independent
        of <strong>version independence</strong>, in practice, one tends to
        follow the other.</p>
    <blockquote>Aside:<em> It should at least be at least feasible to not have one
            follow the other, consider these scenarios:</em>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Many-repos where one repo depends <strong>always</strong> on the HEAD of another.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>A single repo, where one Python package depends on another
                        package <strong>at a different commit within the same repo</strong>.</em></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        It's also possible to imagine some funky setup with one master repo (that's maybe in charge
        of deployment and integration testing) that contains one <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">Git submodule</a>
        for each component.
    </blockquote>

    <h2 id="language-independence">Language Independence</h2>
    <p>Choosing to have a mix of languages impacts the feasibility of
        various other methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Communication</strong> - no more language-level function
                calls. <p><em>(Aside: How difficult to implement is eg. a Python call to a Node
                    process to server-side render some React be?)</em></p></p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Dependency Specification</strong> - no more utilising
                language-level package tooling.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In practice, there will often be eg. Python and TypeScript living
        alongside each other. It might be advantageous to mix and match
        different kinds of components and methods in this case.</p>
    <h2 id="database-independence">Database Independence</h2>
    <p>Sometimes a component has many databases (maybe a separate time
        series db for a particular domain). The consensus is that the opposite - having many
        components sharing one database - is a no-go, in this case the coupling is such that you
        only <em>truly</em> have one component.
    </p>
    <p>More databases means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            <p>More <strong>isolation</strong>.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p>The potential for better <strong>performance</strong>.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p>The potential for worse <strong>performance</strong> by being forced
                into doing cross-database JOINs at the application level.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p>Worse <strong>consistency</strong> - cross database transactions are
                hard to do.</p>

        </li>
        <li>

            <p>Worse <strong>debugging</strong>, the number of things you can JOIN
                across to debug is reduced. This is somewhat surmountable with
                data-lake-y things.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>

        sized codebases (that is to say, almost all codebases). The following table summarises the choices made,
        comparing them to the two dominating approaches:

    <p>Manipleservices adopt further deployment
        independence/communication methods <strong>only when there
            are concrete reasons to do so</strong>.</p>

    <p>
        Why did we pick these methods?
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Splitting Into Components</strong> - We pick a handful - it's all in the name, a maniple.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Dependency Specification</strong> - We're explicit so we can always test/deploy everything that we need to, but nothing more.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Communication</strong> - Until there's some RPC library with excellent typing and good CMD-clickability, function calls are a vastly superior dev experience. The benefits from sending things over wire aren't big enough for most medium codebases.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Deployment Independence</strong> - The benefits of doing this are only really present with very large codebases/organisations. It's worth restating, that this is largely orthogonal to version independence.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Version Independence</strong> - This might be the first thing you'd change when looking from a reliability perspective, being able to A-B test core features is good. However, until you actually see incidents where a root fix would have been to do this, the complexity introduced in testing and developer tooling probably isn't worth it.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Separate Repos</strong> - The Github (or equivalent) tooling needs to improve for monorepos, getting the CI right is tricky, but code <a href="#rot">enters long term decline</a> in many-repos.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Language Independence</strong> - There don't seem to be many projects that try get cross-language typing/in process communication working well. For this reason, combined with the choice of function-calls-by-default, we try keep the number of languages in use low.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Database Independence</strong> - A handful of DBs makes it largely possible to avoid cross-component N+1 patterns, while still letting us tune specific databases for specific performance characteristics.</p></li>
        </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Components are installable packages. (See also <a href="https://blogs.newardassociates.com/blog/2023/you-want-modules-not-microservices.html">You Want Modules, Not Microservices</a>).</p></li>
        <li><p>A dependency tree of the entire system is encoded in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> files via <code>-e</code> installs.</p></li>
        <li><p>CI builds continuation jobs based on which component(s) change and their dependencies.</p></li>
        <li><p>We only call functions from <code>&lt;other-package&gt;.api</code>, this is by convention, but should probably be linted (and linted such that only "dumb data" can cross the interface).</p></li>
        <li><p>Note that we don't import any types from <code>&lt;other-package&gt;</code>, we make our own types.
            <ul>
                <li><p>When we call <code>&lt;other-package&gt;.api.f(a)</code>, <code>a</code> only has to conform to a <code>Protocol</code>, not a nominal type.</p></li>
                <li><p>In the return type from <code>&lt;other-package&gt;.api(...) -&gt;</code>, we can just choose which bits we need, we don't have to conform to the whole return type.</p></li>
                <li><p><code>mypy</code> will check that everything lines up.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>The aim of the above, is that if we for some reason wanted to switch inter-package communication from function calls to eg. REST, it should be trivial.</p></li>
        <li><p>In <code>.circleci/continue.py</code>, <code>changed_packages(...)</code> could be any function that returns a list of packages that you think have changed. Ditto with <code>add_dependant_packages(...)</code> - this would normally add any packages that depend on the ones that have changed.</p></li>
        <li><p>As well as packages that are "service-like", you'd have eg: <code>packages/shop_integration_tests</code> that might depend on <code>account</code> and <code>shop</code> and run tests that depend on both of them.</p></li>
        <li><p>To complement the above, we might want that by convention, eg: <code>shop</code> would monkeypatch any methods of <code>account.api</code> that it uses during testing.</p></li>
