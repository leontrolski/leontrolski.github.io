SI Units for Astronauts

The doors of the craft open into the cold, hazy atmosphere of [Proxima Centauri b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b). Plans are afoot for a new workshop, fully equipped with sets of super-high-precision callipers, but alas! the cabin boy forgot to pack the [International prototype metre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_metre#International_prototype_metre) he picked up on his trip to Paris.

Thankfully, as of [2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units), we can work out all of our SI units from natural physical constants, let's get to work...

Firstly, a reminder of our units:

- Time - seconds (`s`)
- Distance - metres (`m`)
- Current - amperes (`A`)
- Mass - kilograms (`kg`)
- Temperature - kelvin (`K`)
- Luminous intesity - candelas (`cd`)

(We're going to [ignore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)#Criticism) Moles).

# Why

At various points in time, we've had lumps of metal in Paris that were the official kilogram, metre etc. These kind of definitions have some issues - notably that they can change (the kilo has [got a bit lighter](https://phys.org/news/2019-05-adieu-le-grand-kilogram-redefined.html)) and they're not universal (as in we'd have to drag one all the way to Proxima Centauri b). For our new definitions, we've **fixed** the constants (eg. the speed of light in a vacuum) and we derive the units from them.

## Time

Time depends on none of the other SI units for its definition.

[Vibrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#Atomic_definition) some caesium. Like a tuning fork, it has natural frequencies. Count `9,192,631,770` back and forths, and that was a second.

## Distance

Distance is a function of time and a constant.

Measure the distance some light travels, in a vacuum, in `1 / 299,792,458` seconds, that was a metre.

## Current

Current is a function of time and a constant.

A unit of electrical charge is `1.602176634 × 10−¹⁹`. The unit of this number is `A ⋅ s.`.

## Mass

Mass is a function of time, distance and a constant.

The Planck constant is `6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴`. The unit of this number is `kg ⋅ m² ⋅ s⁻¹`. 

Using a [Kibble balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble_balance), measure the electrical power (`kg ⋅ m² ⋅ s⁻³`) required to counteract some weight. 

## Temperature

Temperature is a function of time, distance, mass and a constant.

The Boltzmann constant is `1.380649 × 10⁻²³`. The unit of this number is `kg ⋅ m² ⋅ s⁻² ⋅ K⁻¹`.

## Luminous intensity

Luminous intensity is a function of time, distance, mass, an angle and a constant.

The constant is `683`. The unit of this number is `cd ⋅ sr ⋅ kg⁻¹ ⋅ m⁻² ⋅ s³` where `sr` is a [dimensionless way of measuring angles in 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian).
