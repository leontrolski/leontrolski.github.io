        <h1>Wheel Building Tips</h1>
        <p>
            There are plenty of guides around on bicycle wheel building, here's some bonus tips that I've found useful over the years.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Measure thrice before ordering spokes.</li>
            <li>You don't <em>need</em> a fancy wheel building jig, a zip tie round the frame/fork can still lead to a decent wheel.</li>
            <li>Buy the fancy Torx/Squorx spoke nipples (eg. <code>DT Swiss NPBH20150N0100</code>) and a matching driver (eg. <code>DT Swiss TLDT113</code>). This makes the whole process 40% more pleasurable.</li>
            <li>A guy I worked had a side hustle building wheels for the cycle speedway(!) scene. He had a nice simple method that has yielded consistent results for me:
                <ol>
                    <li>Lace the wheel.</li>
                    <li>Tighten each nipple until 2 threads are showing. Try and be as exact as possible here!</li>
                    <li>Do up each nipple a quarter-turn.</li>
                    <li>Repeat 3. until the spokes seem tight enough (compare by hand to anoyther decent wheel).</li>
                    <li>True in the frame/jig.</li>
                </ol>
                Consistency is key here, go valve-hole to valve-hole in the same direction. Don't stop half way through a rotation.
            </li>
            <li>In the truing stage, again, aim for consistency - tighten/loosen a quarter-turn in pairs, and only when the wheel is at a highpoint where it skims your gauge. Don't try do too much <em>by feel</em>.</li>
        </ul>
