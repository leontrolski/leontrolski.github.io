# Against Abstract Ideas

> I think the people of this country have had enough of experts from organisations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong.

Michael Gove, 2016

I have some misgivings about Michael Gove and his politics, however, ten years as a professional software developer have given me some sympathy with "the people of this [great, surely?] country". I dislike an acronym as much as the next person, my real beef though lies with lofty abstract ideas. This post will ramble, wade and veer between software, politics and philosophy, hold on tight.

## Definitions

I'm going to make an attempt to define an "abstract idea" as opposed to a "concrete idea". It's tempting otherwise for me to choose "abstract" ideas as simply "ideas I disagree with" - one should always aim for [falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper#Philosophy_of_science) and avoid true Scotsmen.

# Philosophy

Non moral, ethics, political, analytic.

[consciousness](consciousness.html)

> In immediate self-consciousness the simple ego is absolute object, which, however, is for us or in itself absolute mediation, and has as its essential moment substantial and solid independence. The dissolution of that simple unity is the result of the first experience; through this there is posited a pure self-consciousness, and a consciousness which is not purely for itself, but for another, i.e. as an existent consciousness, consciousness in the form and shape of thinghood. Both moments are essential, since, in the first instance, they are unlike and opposed, and their reflexion into unity has not yet come to light, they stand as two opposed forms or modes of consciousness. [etc, etc].

[Hegel in The Phenomenology of Spirit](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel#The_Phenomenology_of_Spirit_(1807)) - never one for [Orwell's 6 rules](https://sites.duke.edu/scientificwriting/orwells-6-rules/).


> I use the term consciousness inclusively. It refers both to the information about which I am aware and to the process of being aware of it. In this scheme, consciousness is the more general term and awareness the more specific. Consciousness encompasses the whole of personal experience at any moment, whereas awareness applies only to one part, the act of experiencing. [...] How knowledge can be encoded in the brain is not fundamentally mysterious, but how we become aware of the information is. Whether I am aware of myself as a person, or aware of the feel of a cool breeze, or aware of a color, or aware of an emotion, the awareness itself is the mystery to be explained, not the specific knowledge about which I am aware.

# History/Politics

> The Utopian politician may present his case in the following way: We must determine our ultimate political aim, the Ideal State, before taking any political action whatever. Only when this ultimate aim is determined, in broad outlines at least, only when we are in the possession of something like a blueprint of the society at which we aim, only then can we consider the best ways and means of its realization [...] This is in brief the approach [...] of the Utopian social engineer. It is convincing and attractive; but this makes it in my opinion only the more dangerous, and its criticism the more imperative.

[Karl Popper](popper-reality.html)

Popper's politics are a reaction to 20th century blah, here's Marx (admittedly on a bad day) who is bascially Popper's definition of the historicist thinker. Note the influence

> Communism is the genuine resolution of the antagonism between man and nature and between man and man; it is the true resolution of the conflict between existence and essence, objectification and self-affirmation, freedom and necessity, individual and species. It is the riddle of history solved and knows itself as the solution.
