    <h1>Magic Views</h1>
    <em>Or, thoughts on <b>turning the database inside out</b> and <b>incremental view maintenance</b>.</em>
    <p>Make this weird bit shorter, then explain yourself more - what's the point?</p>
    <p>
        Many moons ago, I found myself really enjoying <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/">Turning the Database Inside Out</a> by Martin Kleppmann (also author of <a href="http://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>). On rereading months later, I formed a blanket distaste for the post and its many proponents, but coming full circle, I've since <b>rere</b>read the piece and enjoyed it - what happened? 🤷
    </p>
    <p>
        I said I enjoyed it, what I really meant was that I enjoyed the first two thirds - TDIO's recommendations I'm less sure of - let's have a look.
    </p>
    <h2>TDIO's starting point</h2>
    <p>
        In a nutshell, here's what all the nice diagrams in TDIO say:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Caches</b> (Redis and friends) can be good, they are a copy of data in a more usefully (in this case <em>quickly</em>) accessible form. They are a faff to keep up to date.</li>
        <li><b>Indexes</b> on databases are also good, they are a copy of data in a more usefully accessible form. Importantly, they are automagically kept up to date by the database in an ACID way, nice!</li>
        <li><b>Materialized Views</b> are kind-of like indexes, they are a copy of data in a more useful form, we can have aggregates, joins, etc. They (in postgres at least) aren't automagically/efficiently kept up to date, boo!</li>
        <li>SQL is a bit rubbish at expressing some of the transformations we want to do on data, we could use stored procedures in other languages, but yughh!</li>
        <li>Read replicas of databases are fed by streams of immutable facts - <code>UPDATE this</code>, <code>ADD that</code>, etc. Append only logs of facts are good.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>TDIO's proposal</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Write everything as immutable events to a log - let's use <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a>.</li>
        <li>Process/aggregate log data on the fly - let's use <a href="http://samza.apache.org/">Apache Samza</a>. This has extensible versions of SQL's <code>WHERE</code>, <code>JOIN</code> etc. and a whole <a href="http://samza.apache.org/learn/documentation/latest/api/samza-sql.html">SQL  interface</a> that supports the <code>COUNT()</code> aggregation.</li>
        <li>These views of the log data are maintained in traditional dbs/caches. We only <em>read</em> from these.</li>
        <li>Streams everywhere, bring 'em in to the UI etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A general view of the problem</h2>
    <p>
        I'm going to have a go trying to describe our problem in a fairly general way - some of this may be better described in the <a href="#literature">academic literature</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Replace <sub>t</sub>s with the delta t approach

        Let's call data at a point in time <code>d<sub>t</sub></code>, Caches, Indexes and Materialized Views are a function of data <code>f(d<sub>t</sub>)</code>.
        <ul>
            <li>Caches are limited in that <code>f</code> can only be the identity function and it can only operate on one row of <code>d</code> at a time. To compute <code>f(d<sub>t+1</sub>)</code> is in principle easy, but faffy in practice.</li>
            <li>Indexes have an <code>f</code> that can do many things (eg. <code>UPPER(row)</code>), but it is similarly limited to one row of <code>d</code> at a time. Computing <code>f(d<sub>t+1</sub>)</code> is easy and automatic.</li>
            <li>Materialized Views have a powerful <code>f</code> that can do joins, aggregates and other exciting things, not only that, they can consider the whole of <code>d</code>. Computing <code>f(d<sub>t+1</sub>)</code> is potentially inefficient and not automatic.</li>
        </ul>
        If we summarise the things we need to consider.
        <ol id="consider">
            <li>How expressive can <code>f</code> be?</li>
            <li>How much of <code>d</code> can <code>f</code> consider?</li>
            <li>Can we compute <code>f(d<sub>t+1</sub>)</code> efficiently?</li>
            <li>Can we store <code>f(d)</code> in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a> way?</li>
            <li>Can we ↕/↔ scale?</li>
            <li>How <em>easy</em> was all that? (Did I add one line of code somewhere and relax, or did I have to write loads of code/deploy something/maintain something/etc).</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3 id="indexes"><em>Aside on functional covering indexes</em></h3>
    <p>
        It's an oft-forgot thing how expressive indexes can be
    </p>

    <h2>Why it's a great idea</h2>
    <p>
        Let's call it Magic Views, describe just in SQL terms, this will allow us to focus on ... and ignore infra etc≈.
        How immutable/temporal tables can be a subset of Magic View functionality.
        This is why I haven't included immutability in "things we need to consider" - this just becomes a design option (a good one).

    </p>

    <h2>Issues</h2>
    <p>
        Some of these are just problems with the TDIO "Kafka and friends" approach.

        Do these do away with the need for ACID? probs not, but why..
        Note there are two orthogonal ideas here:
        (Warning: some of this is from the dev grapevine rather than personal working experience).
        Querying!!

        Caveat: the following is applicable to classic CRUD app development, it <em>probably</em> doesn't apply to the whizz-bang data warehouse processing a bazillion mouseclick events a second.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider locking in account, how does one implement this with just a stream? "If materialized views are only ever updated via the log, then a whole class of race conditions goes away: the log defines the order in which writes are applied"</li>
        <li>Doing simple things where we would have just done a <code>COUNT(*) ... GROUP BY ...</code> often look <a href="https://samza.apache.org/startup/quick-start/latest/samza.html#add-word-count-processing-logic">hairy</a>.</li>
        <li>migrating</li>
        <li>tooling</li>
        <li>typing</li>
        <li>Similarly GDPR</li>
        <li>"But what about transactions?" - see links in TDIO</li>
        <li>data access arbitrary select</li>
        <li>How much data can be cached, how much is "on request"</li>
        <li>Scaling might be important, but <a href="contrair-articles.html#scaling">probably isn't</a>, at least be aware that you're probably trading it for a big chunk of developer agility.</li>
        <li>What if we change <code>f</code>/migrate the underlying data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Other interesting players</h2>
    <h3>Materialize</h3>
    <p>
        The folk at <a href="https://materialize.io/">materialize</a> seem to have solved the problem of ..., but not ...
        timely dataflows - are these online or whatever - read paper

        Do the differential dataflows somehow support all aggregations in a general way? Averages vs median, online learning. Whutttt
    </p>
    <h3>Incremental View Maintenance</h3>
    <p>
        Incremental views are ...
    </p>
    <p>
        Some crazy guy is <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/2019/schedule/attachments/546_pgcon2019.pdf">trying</a> to do these in postgres. (Page with all links <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Incremental_View_Maintenance">here</a>). It's unclear to me how many other attempts like this there have been.

        A bit more here.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <a href="">post</a> by citus in 2016 recommends a <code>TRIGGER</code>-based solution to maintaining a simple <code>COUNT(*)</code> of a table. This is the only <em>exact</em> way of counting it recommends that has good read performance, and yet even with that simple a trigger, inserts "are fifty times slower".
    </p>
    <p>
        To give an idea of the complexity entailed in implementing ACID Magic Views, here is a quote from <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/images/8/85/Materialised_Views_-_FOSDEM.pdf">a talk</a> at pgDay 2014, detailing how "eager" one's incremental updates might be:
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Very Eager – Applied before incrementing command counter so appears up-to-date within the transaction.</li>
                <li>Eager – Applied at commit time, and visible with all other changes in the transaction.</li>
                <li>Inbetween – Queued to apply immediately after transaction commit asynchronously.</li>
                <li>Lazy – Queued to apply on a specified schedule.</li>
                <li>Very Lazy – Queued to be applied on demand.</li>
                <li>Trade-off: More eager = fresh more frequently but with the price of greater overhead.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    <h3>Datomic</h3>
    <p>
        I would claim temporal databases are a subset

        why??

        <a href="https://www.datomic.com/">Datomic</a> is Rich Hickey's go at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_database">temporal database</a>.

        Internet grapevines have a a mixed opinion of Datomic's performance characteristics.
    </p>


    <h2>What do we do? Practical issues to overcome.</h2>
    <p>
        Where does there appear to be space?

        Do we need a DB standard on reading streams containing <code>UPDATE this</code>?
    </p>

    <h2 id="literature">Academic Literature</h2>
    <p>
        There is academic literature describing some of the above, starting points: googling for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=incremental+view+maintenance">incremental view maintenance</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/timelydataflow/differential-dataflow/blob/master/differentialdataflow.pdf">differential dataflow</a> paper.
